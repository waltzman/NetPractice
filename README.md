# Description

The goal of this project is to study the basic concepts of computer networking using IPv4 communication
protocol.

# Basic concepts

By completing this project the student will be capable to configure simple networks using IPv4 adresses,
do subnetting and configuring routing tables.

# Instructions

To start a project you must download the archive attached to the project page.
Extract the files, and run **index.html** file.

When you run index.html file the integi rface has two options:

## Training

If you input your login in the field, you can practice configuring small networks.

There are 10 levels available for training.
For each level, a non-functioning (broken) network scheme appears.
It includes separate hosts, newtworks, routers, routing tables.
The tables have *shaded* or *unshaded* fields.
To configure the network you must modify the unshaded fields.

If your configuration is correct, a new button will appear: **Next level**

## Evaluation

Use evaluation tab to do three random configurations.
